				     xx xxx 2013

The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.2 has been to fix bugs and correct
minor cosmetic errors to streamline the use of Snowmix. The relase also
includes some perfomance enhancements as well as adding animation to audio
volumes. The release is compatible with ini files for version 0.4.x with
the exceptions that some commands as explained in the ChangeLog has
minor changes to the result.

This release introduce the following 12 new commands:

	audio feed move volume - animation of volume for audio feeds.
	audio mixer move volume - animation of volume for audio mixers.
	audio mixer source move volume - animation of volume for source for audio mixers.
	audio sink move volume - animation of volume for audio sinks.
	shape arcrel_cw - relative placement of an arc element
	shape arcrel_cww - relative placement of an arc element
	shape source alphaadd - adding a constant to the alpha level.
	shape source alphamul - multiply a factor to the alpha level.
	shape tell scale - for debugging purposes.
	text place backgr round - for round corners of text background.
	text place font - quick change of the font of a placed text.
	text place string - quick change of the string of a placed text.

Further details are available in the ChangeLog.

This release has been performance optimized and/or enhanced further in the
following ares or for the specific commands:

	Update loop of all placed text using the animation command *move*.
	Parsing of all **text** commands.
	Parsing of all **feed** commands.
	All **text place** commands are now checked and will return error in case of error.
	Command image load now closes the file it reads.
	The command text grow is now by default using a fixed size for placing and for background, but size can be set variable if desired.
	feed list - cometic changes
	feed info - additional information
	feed add - can now list feeds as other add comands.

Further details are available in the ChangeLog.

This release fixes a couple of bugs for the following commands:

	shape list - was not listing all entries in a shape correctly.
	shape source rgb/rgba - was mixing the print of the two variants in verbose mode.
	shape help - missing rectangle entry.
	shape recursion - made a printing error in verbose mode.
	shape line width - cosmetic printing error in verbose mode.
	shape inshape - cosmetic printing error in verbose mode.
	shape arc_ccw - was parsed incorrectly and thus unusable.
	shape list help - was printing incorrect syntax for some commands.
	shape move entry - was in some cases erronously deleting an entry.
	text string concat - was core dumping.
	pattern add - was deleting a shape rather than a pattern.

Further details are available in the ChangeLog.

In addition to the enhancements and fixes of Snowmix, the control and validation tool snowcub.tcl has been updated with more functions. Snowcub remain currently undocumented.

Last but not least, a collection of Snowmix library functions implemented in Tcl is available in the slib library. These functions includes scene creation and management, clocks, graphs and a radar application that can be used in Snowmix and controlled by Snowcub.

As always, you can the updated information on how to compile and run the demo on:

			Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.4.1

			  Copyright 2013 - Peter Maersk-Moller
				     4th July 2013


The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.1 has been to add shapes to Snowmix.
Shapes adds support for complex graphics and image drawing, clipping, patterns,
gradients and masking using graphic primitives of the 2D Cairo Graphics library.
In this context, a video feed is an image that happens to change at the frame
rate.  More information on the Cairo Graphics library is available at
http://cairographics.org/

In Snowmix shapes are macros with zero or more Cairo Graphics commands. This
release adds support for the following 46 new basic shapes commands where
the Cairo Graphics commands are marked with *)

	shape add
	shape arc_cw		*)
	shape arc_ccw		*)
	shape clip		*)
	shape closepath		*)
	shape curveto		*)
	shape curverel		*)
	shape feed		*)
	shape fill		*)
	shape fill preserve	*)
	shape help
	shape info
	shape image		*)
	shape inshape		*)
	shape line width	*)
	shape line join		*)
	shape line cap		*)
	shape lineto		*)
	shape linerel		*)
	shape list
	shape mask pattern	*)
	shape moveentry
	shape moverel		*)
	shape moveto		*)
	shape newpath		*)
	shape operator		*)
	shape overlay
	shape paint		*)
	shape pattern add
	shape pattern radial	*)
	shape pattern linear	*)
	shape pattern stoprgb	*)
	shape recursion
	shape restore		*)
	shape rotation		*)
	shape save		*)
	shape scale		*)
	shape source rgb	*)
	shape source rgba	*)
	shape source pattern	*)
	shape stroke		*)
	shape stroke preserve	*)
	shape translate		*)
	shape transform		*)
	shape verbose
	shape place help

For most shape commands their names (largely), function and parameter values
are identical to the corresponding commands available in the Cairo Graphics
library. For this reason, much documentation on the use and function of the
graphic primitives are available on the Cairo Graphics webpages.

A placed shape is an abstraction of a shape with coordinates (its placement),
a rotation, a scale, an offset, a base color and an alpha value. In addition
to the basic shape commands, the release also adds support for the following 14
shape place commands:

	shape place
	shape place alpha
	shape place coor
	shape place move alpha
	shape place move coor
	shape place move offset
	shape place move rotation
	shape place move scale
	shape place offset
	shape place rgb
	shape place rotation
	shape place scale
	shape place shape
	shape place status 

The 5 move commands adds animation for placed shapes for scale, coordinates, rotation,
offset and alpha blend.

Other new commands in this release are:

	messagef
	text place clipabs
	image write
	audio mixer source invert
	system host allow

The image write command is not recommended used for live systems due to possible delay.

In addition to the new commands, a number of changes and bugfixes are also included in
this release. Details for these new commands are listed in the ChangeLog.

To install and run demo, please execute the following commands:

	$ tar -xzvf Snowmix-0.4.1
	$ cd Snowmix-0.4.1
	$ sh bootstrap
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ cd scripts
	$ bash demo
