To see updated requirements and updated how to install Snowmix, please visit
https://sourceforge.net/p/snowmix/wiki/Compiling%20and%20Installing/

			PLEASE SEE THE RELEASE NOTES.

===============================================================================

Requirements:

The following packages may have to be installed to a fresh installaion of Ubuntu 12.04 i386 server. This has also now been verified for Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 desktop.

    build-essential
    automake
    libtool
    pkg-config
    g++
    libgtk+-3.0 libgtk-3-dev
    libgstreamer0.10-dev gstreamer-tools
    libsdl1.2-dev
    libosmesa6-dev
    tcl-dev
    gstreamer-tools

Installing these packages can be done by executing

	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf libtool g++ pkg-config libgtk-3-dev gtk+-3.0 libsdl1.2-dev tcl-dev libosmesa6-dev gstreamer-tools libgstreamer0.10-dev

To install and run demo, please execute the following commands (here for version 0.4.1):

	$ tar -xzvf Snowmix-0.4.1
	$ cd Snowmix-0.4.1
	$ sh bootstrap
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ cd scripts
	$ bash demo

You may choose to run

	$ sh strapboot

to clean everything up before you run bootstrap.

Use './configure -help' to see options for changing installation dir among others

How to test something else than demo - DO NOT RUN AS root

	In the snowmix directory
	$ cd src
	$ ./snowmix ../ini/basic_feeds

	Now for Snowmix to work, you need to feed it some live feeds. Below
	is shown how you can simulate 4 inputs. The following commands are
	all excuted from the scripts directory (snowmix/scripts)

	$ cd sripts
	$ xterm -e sh input2feed1-704 &
	$ xterm -e sh input2feed2-704 &
	$ xterm -e sh input2feed3-704 &
	$ xterm -e sh input2feed4-1024 &
	$ xterm -e sh output2screen &

	The last command starts a GStreamer pipeline that reads from output
	of Snowmix and display to screen.

	In the original window, where you started Snowmix, you can now
	type commands. To begin with, you can type 'help' and press
	return. Type 'quit' when you want to stop Snowmix. If you terminate
	Snowmix in any other way, some of the shared memory allocated
	will stay allocate and build up until you can not start Snowmix
	again. Allocated shared memory can be found listed in /run/shm
	and can be deallocated by deleting files in there. However if
	you don't know what you are doing, bets are you will create
	problems for you and your machine.
	

	Running Snowmix with the ini file basic_feeds sets up four feeds
	and display them with some additional text and images.

	If you want to test the capability of virtual feeds instead of
	basic feeds, you can quit Snowmix and start it again with one
	of the ini files

		- ini/virtual_feeds
		- ini/virtual_feeds_2

	However, when you quit Snowmix, you will either have to restart
	all your input feeds (the scripts you started before) or wait until
	they starts over (which they in this example do after 2 minutes,
	as the clip they play are 2 minutes long approx.). Should be trivial
	to do a 'killall -1 gst-launch' or automate i other ways, but that
	is up to YOU!.


How to install (you may have to run as root depending on install destination)
